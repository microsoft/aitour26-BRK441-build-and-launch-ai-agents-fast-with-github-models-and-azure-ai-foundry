# Demo Instructions: Export Agent Code

**Instructions**: View the **Agent Builder** screen. Remove the {{products}} variable within the **User Prompt**. Select the **Prompt** tab.

**Script**: For now, let’s focus on getting the agent into a real-world product. One of Serena’s colleagues created the UI for the Cora app and passed along the project files. Therefore, the frontend is complete. What’s missing is the brain behind it: the agent logic, the call to the MCP server, and the model responses.​

​**Instructions**: Select the **View Code** button. Select **Azure AI Inference SDK**. Select **Python**. View the code.

**Script**: With the AI Toolkit, Serena can export the agent code via her preferred SDK. ​​But after getting the code for the agent, she still needs to merge her agent code with the existing app code. Serena could spend time going through her colleague’s project and spend cycles attempting to make everything work together. But there was a more efficient way for Serena to approach this challenge.  ​
