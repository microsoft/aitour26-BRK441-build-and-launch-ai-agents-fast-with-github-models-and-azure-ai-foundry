# Demo Instructions: Add Tools

**Instructions**: Scroll down to the **Tools** section in the **Agent Builder**.

**Script**: Back here in the Agent Builder, I can connect to Zava’s custom MCP server and add whichever tools will be relevant for Cora. Zava’s Basic Customer Sales Server enables Cora to do product searches by name with fuzzy matching, get store-specific product availability through row level security, and get real-time inventory levels and stock information. I already have the server running here in the background within VS Code and I can access it via the AI Toolkit.​

​**Instructions**: Select the **+** icon next to **Tools**. Select the running server. Add the **get_products_by_name** tool. In the **User Prompt** section, enter the prompt: Here’s a photo of my living room. I’m not sure whether I should go with eggshell or semi-gloss. Can you tell which would work better based on the lighting and layout?​ Run the prompt.

**Script**: I’m going to add the get_products_by_name tool to Cora and submit another prompt to see whether Cora searches through Zava’s product catalog before generating its output to a customer.​

---

​**Instructions**: Review the output. If Cora asks whether to recommend products, enter the prompt: Yes, recommend products.​

**Script**: Here in the model output, I can see the tool call and yes, Cora did call the get_products_by_name tool. Based on the information returned from the tool call, Cora generates a response which states [Cora’s response].​

Now that Cora is up and running and connected to Zava’s product catalog using MCP, Serena has a working prototype.​

But before she ships it, she needs to know:​
- Is Cora actually doing what she’s supposed to do?​
- Are the responses clear? Trustworthy? Helpful?​

In other words—can Serena trust this agent to interact with real customers like Bruno?​
