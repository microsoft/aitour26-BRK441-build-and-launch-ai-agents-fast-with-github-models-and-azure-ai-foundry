# Demo Instructions: Cora App

**Instructions**: Open the Cora app via the web. Enter the prompt: Here's a picture of my living room. I'm not sure whether I should go with eggshell or semi-gloss. Can you tell me which would work better based on the lighting and layout? Next, upload the living room photo located in img/demo-living-room.png. Run the prompt.

**Script**: Remember Bruno? Let’s pretend we’re Bruno for a second and we need a recommendation for painting the living room. I’ll pass in the prompt, a photo of the living room, and see what Cora returns.​

**Instructions**: Review the output. Follow up with the prompt: Recommend eggshell paint. Then review the output. Alternatively, if Cora already recommended the paint in the prior response, ask Cora: How much is Zava's eggshell paint?

**Script**: Let's now ask Cora to recommend a Zava eggshell paint OR Let's now ask Cora how much is Zava's eggshell paint.
